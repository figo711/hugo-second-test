TP1 - Summer wishes and regrets

I should have prepared for the start of the school year.
I regret spending a few hours playing video games instead of doing workouts.
If only I had a time machine to go back to the beginning of the summer holidays.
I wish I hadn't spent most of the time doing nothing.
